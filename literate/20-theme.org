* Basic UI setup

There are a few elements I'd like to fix about the default Emacs UI
configuration, as I like it to be as minimal as possible.

First off, lets disable as many elements that are commonly used with a
mouse as possible.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode 0)
(tool-bar-mode 0)
(scroll-bar-mode 0)
#+end_src

* Theming :noexport:
** Todo               
  - [X] modus themes
    - default vivendi-tinted, might need some reviewing if its the
      best choice as i dont like the blue BG, i'd rather have it
      completely black.  
    - bind key to quick-toggle between light/dark?
  - [ ] doom modeline
  - [ ] ligatures
  - [ ] all the icons? 
  - [ ] emoji support?
  - [ ] hl-line?

* Modus
I really like the [[https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/modus-themes][Modus themes]].  It's easy to configure, has a consistent style and comes in both light and dark modes.
